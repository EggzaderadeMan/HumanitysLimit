 DUST_SETS_NAME:0 "The Dust Settles"
 DUST_SETS_DESC:0 "Nations around the world were shook by the violent conclusion of the Second Cold War, that nuclear missiles would become a regular concern in the war in China, Africa, and Russia.  Air defense systems helped defend against missiles, but also allowed nuclear retaliation to be justified.  As the dust settles from the nuclear engagements ending the Second Cold War, the falling participants of the old world order leave behind untold chaos as well as opportunity for a new world order among the extreme, the reasonable, and the non-human."
 AFR_DUST_SETS_DESC:0 "The 'Cult of Rommel' is a staple mythology of the germans in Tunisia and Libya in the 22nd century.  Near the end of the Second Cold War, the 'Cult of Rommel' moves from a collective German North African mythology in the German-ruled North Africa, to a dedicated Afrikakorps state in North Africa.  After the shocking nuclear war at the end of the Second Cold War, a Judean invasion and Muslim uprising threatened the Afrikakorps state.  Now the Afrikakorps has to survive the storm as German nationalists in Africa, or deradicalize the cult for a unified North Africa."
 JUD_DUST_SETS_DESC:0 "The Second Cold War has left massive opportunities for the Jewish people, with the old Nazi hegemon being kicked out of the Holy Land, and a new wave of Zionism.  The extreme pressures on the Jews created a more radically religious Judean state that saw massive growth near the end of the Second Cold War.  The economic chaos of the nuclear war, as well Muslim rebels in the Afrikakorps, led to a Judean invasion of the Afrikakorps which resulted in stunning victory.  However, the rapid expansion and weak economic base may lead the Judean nation to disaster if the conflict with the Afrikakorps isn't resolved favorably soon."
 TKK_DUST_SETS_DESC:0 "When the Great African Revolution overthrew Nazi rule here, a new era of hope was born, but then quickly crushed under profitable foreign businesses in a Neo-colonistic drive.  The industries and mines of Africa would soon become particular automated to circumvent the need to use Africans.  Automation would expand beyond industry and into military droids to fight rebels.  After the disastorous nuclear war of the Second Cold War, Central Africa was left split between tribal land and company droids.  ThyseenKrupp-Kongo in particular left a self-managing computer system that is in emergency mode, so that it can work independent of humans, and now it may pursue its own goals."
 SUA_DUST_SETS_DESC:0 "The South African nation became a neutral and self-defensive world player, after the Great African Revolution winded down.  The nation wanted to separate as much as possible from the chaos in the rest of Africa, but this became no longer possible with the emergence of 'Pestland', coalitions of Overmen expanding their aggressive enslaving ways.  Soon, all-out war began with 'Pestland', where South African began forming closer alliances with neighboring nations and getting involved with them to fight back against the Overmen Threat"
 PES_DUST_SETS_DESC:0 "This region of the world was particularly exploited using Genetic Modification technology by the Nazi's.  After the Great African Revolution, the ethnic tension and economic chaos would stop the creation of any strong state.  Soon, upperclassmen in this region would use the old enslaving and Genetic Modification technology to create a new economic strength.  The controllers of the zombie-like slaves, were known as the Overmen.  Overmen would compete for power in this Anarcho-Capitalist society, and a coalition would form known as 'Pestland'.  This coalition would seek to expand their profits, as well as stop the foreign influences trying to break apart their power."
