# HumanitysLimit
 A collaborative Hearts of Iron IV mod

This folder needs to go in 
	'Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod'

Place 'humanityslimit.mod' outside this folder

If you are having issues with the mod showing, there is a workaround: 
Rename this mod folder and the humanityslimit.mod to something else
In the Launcher, Go to 'All Installed Mods', then click 'Upload Mod' in the top right
Click 'Create a Mod' and fill in the info (Name: Humanity's Limit, Version: 1.12.4, Directory: mod/humanityslimit)
After clicking 'Create Mod', a blank mod file will appear, copy and paste of this folder's contents into that new mod folder
Then copy and paste this mod's .mod file into the newly created one
Delete this folder and it's .mod file after all the files and info has been transferred to the newly created mod folder and .mod file
